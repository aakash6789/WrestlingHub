      title:'Raw',
      description:`<p>
      Monday Night Raw made its debut on January 11, 1993, and was a revolutionary concept at the time. It was the brainchild of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, designed to be a live, weekly, prime-time wrestling show that aired on the USA Network. The show's premise was to bring the excitement and drama of wrestling to fans in their living rooms every Monday night.
      Monday Night RAW is the flagship program of the WWE umbrella, dishing up 3 hours of sports entertainment content on the USA Network, on a weekly basis. Along with SmackDown Live, WWE RAW forms what is considered to be the ‘main roster’ of WWE and RAW is alternatively referred to as the A-Show, as well as the ‘red brand’.Professional wrestling has been a staple of Monday nights since 1993 when WWE RAW first aired from the Manhattan Center. While the show originally aired live, certain episodes would be taped after an episode was telecast live, to save costs over the long haul.Everything would change after the arrival of WWE’s competitors- World Championship Wrestling whose flagship show WCW Monday Nitro (a play on Monday Night RAW) would surpass WWE RAW in ratings for weeks on end. WCW and the man at the helm, Eric Bischoff, were not afraid to play dirty and would often give out the results of taped RAW shows on air. This would lead to RAW going live more often, and also adding an extra hour (going from 1 hour to 2) to counter World Championship Wrestling programming.WWE RAW would go to 3 hours from the year 2012, which marked the 1000th episode of the brand. Monday Night RAW would celebrate its 20th Anniversary in 2012 and its 25th Anniversary in 2018, both with very special shows. It currently airs on USA Network. Digitally, fans can watch episodes of RAW on the WWE Network. But, the network has ceased to operate in USA and fans can watch the same on Peacock TV.
      RAW is WAR
      At the peak of the Monday Night Wars with WCW, the latter gained the lead by a significant margin with the nWo angle, which was a lot edgier than anything WWE was putting on. In order to compete with World Championship Wrestling, WWE RAW would change its name to RAW is War in the year 1997, in line is what is known as the Attitude Era of WWE, where the programming became a lot more mature than it was.
      <br></br>
      Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the RAW is WAR name was retired for obvious reasons and just became WWE RAW. A brand split would happen after Vince McMahon purchased his competition WCW, owing to an over-abundance of talent as the RAW roster and the SmackDown roster would become exclusive to their brands, and this would last all the way until the year 2011, before returning in 2016.
      Since the inception of the show, WWE Raw has had some stellar introduction show to kick-off the show every Monday night.

        description:`<p>

        WWE NXT has a fascinating history since its inception, evolving from a reality competition series to becoming a critically acclaimed brand of its own within the WWE. Let's delve into the history and transformation of WWE NXT in detail.
        NXT began as a developmental roster for RAW and SmackDown, the primary two programming of WWE. It soon gained the worldwide reputation of being one of the best pro wrestling brands under Triple H. NXT was soon considered the third brand of WWE and even partook in Survivor Series 2019. However, it was rebranded as NXT 2.0 in 2021 and was again made a developmental territory.In its initial days, NXT was a televised competition-oriented show that aimed at crowning a breakout star for the main roster. Over the years, that concept changed and NXT evolved into the grooming place for current top-tier WWE Superstars like Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, Bray Wyatt, and Becky Lynch. If we take a look at the list of talents that got their big break in WWE over the past decade, the majority of them were brought up from the black-and-gold brand.
        NXT’s overwhelming popularity has resulted in the launching of a separate NXT UK brand that showcases some of the elite performers from the United Kingdom wrestling circuit.The current WWE NXT roster features some of the best wrestlers from various corners of the world. Following its revamp, the WWE NXT Championship was the first title that was introduced and Seth Rollins defeated Jinder Mahal to become the inaugural title-holder. While this is the top prize for the male athletes on the brand, the female talents contend for the WWE NXT Women’s Championship.
        <br></br>
        WWE NXT had its origins as a reality competition series that premiered on February 23, 2010. The show featured eight rookie Superstars paired with WWE Pros, established WWE Superstars who served as mentors. These rookies competed in various challenges and in-ring contests to earn a WWE contract.
        
        The first season of NXT introduced fans to emerging talents like Wade Barrett, Daniel Bryan, and The Miz. The show played a crucial role in their journey to becoming mainstays in the WWE. Wade Barrett emerged as the winner of the inaugural season, earning a WWE Championship opportunity.
        There are five major titles on the brand as of now, including the NXT Championship, NXT Tag Team Championship, NXT Women’s Championship, NXT Women's Tag Team Championship and the NXT North American Championship. Additionally, NXT stars are open to challenge for WWE 24/7 Championship as well.As WWE NXT evolved, it transitioned from a reality show into a developmental territory for WWE. The concept of rookies and pros gradually faded, and NXT began to focus on developing and showcasing the skills of up-and-coming talent. This shift was vital in shaping NXT into a brand that emphasized in-ring action and storytelling.
        
        During the developmental era, talents such as Seth Rollins (formerly known as Tyler Black), Big E (formerly Big E Langston), and Bray Wyatt (formerly Husky Harris) made their mark in NXT before moving on to become main roster Superstars.
        
        Owing to NXT becoming a two-hour show in 2019, Superstars from NXT UK and 205 Live appear on the show as well. It is currently known as NXT 2.0.
        <br></br>
        A significant turning point for NXT was the arrival of NXT Arrival, a live special event that aired exclusively on the WWE Network in February 2014. This event marked the birth of NXT TakeOver, a series of critically acclaimed and highly anticipated live shows. NXT TakeOver showcased incredible matches and often surpassed the main roster pay-per-views in terms of quality.
        
        Talents like Sami Zayn, Finn Bálor, and Kevin Owens became synonymous with NXT, delivering unforgettable matches and moments that garnered the attention of wrestling fans worldwide.NXT played a pivotal role in the Women's Evolution in WWE. It featured a roster of highly talented female wrestlers who, over time, revolutionized women's wrestling. Icons such as Paige, Charlotte Flair, Sasha Banks, and Bayley paved the way for the "Four Horsewomen" era, a term that highlighted the contributions of these women to the wrestling industry.
        
        NXT also introduced the Women's Championship, and the women's division consistently delivered classic matches and storylines that elevated the status of female wrestlers in WWE.NXT expanded globally, with the creation of NXT UK in 2018. NXT UK showcased the best talents from the United Kingdom and became a platform for British wrestling to shine. The brand's success further established NXT as a worldwide phenomenonNXT's success led to the integration of NXT talent into the main roster. Superstars like Kevin Owens, Finn Bálor, and Asuka made impactful debuts on Raw and SmackDown, bringing their NXT pedigree to a larger audience. In recent years, the annual Survivor Series pay-per-view incorporated NXT into the brand warfare, further legitimizing NXT as a third major brand in WWE.
        <br></br>
        NXT underwent a significant change in 2021 with the rebranding to NXT 2.0. This new era introduced a vibrant and colorful look, a renewed focus on developing fresh talent, and an emphasis on character-driven storytelling. While some longtime fans of the brand embraced these changes, others mourned the departure from the original "black and gold" NXT.
        
        In summary, WWE NXT has evolved from a reality competition series to a powerful brand within WWE, known for producing top-tier talent and delivering exceptional in-ring action. It has played a pivotal role in the development of future WWE Superstars, the Women's Evolution, and the global expansion of the company. The history of NXT is a testament to the ever-changing landscape of professional wrestling and WWE's ability to adapt and grow with the times.
