            earlyLife:`<p>Roman Reigns was born in Pensacola, Florida on the 25th of May in 1985 as Leati Joseph Anoai, which is his real name. He was born into the decorated Samoan family who has a storied history in the world of pro wrestling. His father Sika was a professional wrestler and so were the various other members of his family.
            Reigns attended Pensacola Catholic High School and Escambia High School and then went on to Georgia Institute of Technology. Anoa' I has cited Bret 'The Hitman' Hart as his wrestling idol.</p>`,

            Roman Reigns moved to wrestle in July 2010, when he signed a contract with WWE and was later drafted to their Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) territory. He made his WWE debut on 9th September 2010 using the ring name Roman Leakee.
            With Roman Reigns age being in the 20s, the former Jacksonville Jaguars player made his singles WWE debut in a losing effort to Richie Steamboat. Roman won his first match in the division after sustaining a couple more losses.
            In 2011, he formed a tag team with Donny Marlow and the duo challenged Calvin Raines and Big E Langston for the FCW Tag Team Championship. However, their attempt would be unsuccessful.<br></br>
            In 2012, Leakee pinned then FCW Heavyweight Champion Leo Kruger during a tag-team match. The match emerged as the starting point of a new feud as Leakee later defeated Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match, becoming the number one contender for the FCW Heavyweight Championship. However, he failed in his mission as he lost to Kruger the following week. Leakee later regained the tag-team titles with Mike Dalton.
            After WWE rebranded FCW to WWE NXT, Leakee changed his ring name to Roman Reigns and made his debut on 31st October to beat CJ Parker. He beat Chase Donovan and wrestled in his last match in the division against Gavin Reids which he won on the December 5 episode of NXT.
            Reigns then pursued his career in professional wrestling and was signed by the WWE in 2010. He made his main roster debut in 2012 as a part of the group, The Shield, along with Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins;.

He also holds the record for the most number of eliminations in the Royal Rumble with 12 in the 2014 edition. The record was then broken by Braun Strowman later.<br></br>
            Reigns have headlined the last four Wrestlemanias and WWE has attempted to establish Reigns as the “face of the company” in the past few years.
            In the episode of RAW following the Survivor Series, The Shield defended their actions by saying that they vowed to battle against injustice and categorically denied working for CM Punk. They would call themselves The Hounds of Justice. However, the group would emerge from the crowd to regularly beat up Punks opponents and adversaries including Ryback and Team Hell No, a tag-team comprising of Kane and Daniel Bryan.<br></br>
            This led to a tag-team match between The Shield and the three adversaries of CM Punk in the TLC: Tables, Ladders, and Chairs pay per view. This was the official debut match of the group, which The Shield easily won.
            The Shield continued to attack Punks opponents, including beating up The Rock who is Roman Reigns cousin. On the January 28, 2013 episode of RAW, it was revealed that CM Punk and his manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield to work for him.

They faced each other on February 17th at the Elimination Chamber which was won by The Shield. The group competed in their first match on RAW in the following episode which they won against Ryback, Sheamus, and Chris Jericho.

The Shield started attacking The Undertaker in the following episode of RAW but were stopped by Team Hell No.<br></br>
            This set up a six-man tag team match in the 22nd April 2013 episode of RAW which The Shield won. The Shields winning streak came to an end when they lost via disqualification in an elimination tag-team match against John Cena, Kane, and Daniel Bryan in the 13th May 2013 episode.<br></br>
            At the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, Reigns won his first belt in WWE as he partnered with Seth Rollins to win the WWE Tag Team Championship in a tornado tag team championship.

Reigns and Rollins lost their titles to Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a no disqualification match following interference from Big Show and went on to lose the rematch against them as well.<br></br>

In the Royal Rumble, Reigns entered the rumble at number 15 and made the record for the most number of eliminations with 12. He was finally eliminated by Batista.
            Just before Wrestlemania XXX, The Shield attacked Jerry Lawler but later turned their attention to Kane. Leading up to the event, they continued to attack Kane who was joined by The New Age Outlaws, thus culminating into a match at the pay-per-view. The Shield won the match. The feud with Kane resulted in The Shield severing ties with Triple H who reformed Evolution once again.<br></br>
            However, The Shield defeated Evolution at Extreme Rules and Payback. Batista quit WWE soon after, which led Triple H to execute his Plan B. This led to Seth Rollins attacking Reigns and Ambrose and as a result, The Shield broke apart

            family:`<p>
            Sika is the father of Roman Reigns. He was one-half of the famous WWE tag team named The Wild Samoans alongside Afa. The duo held a total of 21 tag team championships throughout promotions in their career. They were also inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in the Class of 2007.

            <br></br>
            Afa and Sika saw Peter Maivia as their Uncle due to the latter's close relationship with Reverend Amituana'i Anoai, the father of the Wild Samoans. Dwayne Johnson is the maternal son of Maivia and thus is a member of the Anoa'i Family and is the cousin of Roman Reigns, the son of Sika. Reigns and The Rock are usually considered to be the most successful members of the Anoa'i Family. The two have shared screens on WWE programming including the time when Rock helped Reigns win the 2015 edition of Royal Rumble. Also, the two shared screens in Hollywood in the movie Hobbs and Shaw.
            <br></br>
            The Usos are perhaps the most famous blood relatives of Roman Reigns due to their constant presence around The Tribal Chief in the WWE product. Both Jey and Jimmy Uso were on the side of Reigns throughout the latter's career. They helped him out during his fight with The Authority in 2015 and continued to help him until his feud with Baron Corbin in 2020.
            However, in 2020 only, Jey Uso and Roman Reigns had a couple of hard-hitting battles for the Universal Championship which Reigns won by dominating both The Usos. Since then, Jey and Jimmy have been on Roman's side as a member of The Bloodline.

He also successfully defended it against Cedric Alexander in Clash of Champions and Humberto Carillo at the Crown Jewel. AJ Styles dropped the title to Rey Mysterio on an episode of RAW. In January 2020, AJ Styles entered the Royal Rumble as an eighteenth entrant but was eliminated by Edge after a vicious spear was delivered to him.
            After Royal Rumble, Styles participated in a Tuwaiq Trophy tournament. He was eliminated by the returning Undertaker who took AJ Styles with a Tombstone Piledriver in the middle of the ring. This led to a match between the two at Wrestlemania 36. At Wrestlemania 36, Undertaker picked up the victory against AJ Styles in a Boneyard match despite the assistance from the O.C. AJ Styles then took a sabbatical, and during this time because of the pandemic, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson were released from WWE disbanding the O.C faction.

        description:{
            earlyLife:`<p>
            Hulk Hogan (real name Terry Gene Bollea) is synonymous with professional wrestling as one of the greatest icons of the business. He is considered by many as the first "face of WWE"(succeeded by Stone Cold, The Rock & John Cena) and took the company into a new era, 'The Golden Era' and the wrestling boom period. 
            </p>,`,
            carrer:`<p>
            Long before he became The Immortal One, Terry Bollea was born in Augusta, Georgia on August 11th, 1954. He moved to Port Tampa, Florida at a very young age, and to date resides in Florida. It was Jack and Gerald Briscoe who spotted him at Hector's Gym in Tampa Bay and were impressed with Hogan's physique. They pursued Hogan to join as a trainee for Championship Wrestling from Florida. He was trained by the legendary Hiro Matsuda, who also trained big names such as "Cowboy" Bob Orton, The Great Muta, Scott Hall, Paul Orndoff and Ron Simmons.
            Hogan soon quit wrestling as Matsuda was too rough on the edges. He moved out of Florida and after time away from pro-wrestling, went back and had his debut in August of 1977. After a run in NWA, he eventually joined the WWF, where he had a one-year stint, playing a heel known as "Hulk Hogan".          
            He would then jump ship to New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he spent the next five years of his career. After winning a tournament, Hogan became the first IWGP(International Wrestling Grand Prix) Heavyweight Champion, although this isn't considered the start of the title's lineage. Around the same time, from 1981 to 1983, Hogan made his debut for American Wrestling Association, where he not only turned face, but he had made an appearance on Rocky III, helping his stock grow for his eventual WWF return in 1983. 
            <br></br>
            When he returned to WWF, the ownership was now under Vincent Kennedy McMahon, and not Vincent J. McMahon. Hulk Hogan would become the first real "face of WWF/E" during the company's national expansion and wrestling boom.
            Leading the company, Hogan would headline the first three WrestleManias and after a one-year gap, would main event eight straight WrestleManias(the most of all time, and the most consecutive of all time). Through the Golden Era, Hogan would not only become the most popular wrestler in the world but would also go on to become a pop-culture icon around the world. He would become wrestling's undisputed biggest draw and Hulkamania would run wild for years.
            Some of his most memorable allies and rivals through the years included the likes of Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake, "Macho Man" Randy Savage, Jake "The Snake" Roberts, Bobby "The Brain" Heenan, Earthquake, Sid Justice, Undertaker, Andre The Giant and many more. Hogan's charisma ensured that he remained on top of the WWF food chain for years to come.
            However, around 1992, it seemed like Hulkamania began to sour among fans. The first possible indication of this was during the critically acclaimed 1992 Royal Rumble match, where Hulk Hogan was eliminated by the heel Sid Justice, who got cheered in the process. During their heated confrontation post-match(which was won by Ric Flair) saw a heated argument that saw the fans turn their backs on the fan favorite Hogan.
            <br></br>
            After a period of time off, Hulk Hogan wrestled at WrestleMania IX, teaming with real-life best friend Brutus Beefcake in a losing effort to Money Inc. After Bret Hart's loss to Yokozuna in the main event later that night, Hogan would come out and take on then-new WWF Champion Yokozuna to an impromptu match, which he won in 22-seconds, becoming WWF Champion again.
            He would then drop the title back to Yokozuna in the King Of The Ring PPV a few months later, after which he sat out his contract and then had a brief return to NJPW, before signing for an iconic run with World Championship Wrestling(WCW).
            Hogan won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on his debut match against Ric Flair. He would hold on to the title for a long period of time, and two years later, the unthinkable happened when Hulk Hogan turned heel for the first time since the early 1980s and joined the nWo with Kevin Nash and Scott Hall.
            Hogan's heel turn was a shocking change in the wrestling world and the NWO soon became wrestling's top faction. With six world championships under his belt, Hogan would help elevate WCW to a level above WWF, beating them in television ratings for 82 consecutive weeks.
            Despite everything and a great run, Hogan would leave WCW in 2000 at Bash Of The Beach after a controversial finish in a match against Jeff Jarrett. It would only take another two years for Hogan to return home to the WWE, where he came back along with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash as part of the nWo.<br></br>
            His return after nine years was met with a thunderous response, and despite playing the heel, was constantly cheered throughout, especially during his dream WrestleMania match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8. His popularity would eventually result in him going right back to Hulkamania, where he would win the WWF championship a month after WrestleMania from Triple H, only to lose it shortly to The Undertaker. Hogan was technically  
            the last "WWF" Champion as this was the time the title and the company was re-branded to WWE.
            After a match with the then-up-and-coming Brock Lesnar, Hogan took a hiatus and returned in 2003, where he briefly feuded with The Rock and then faced Vince McMahon at WrestleMania XIX. He quit WWE later that year due to creative frustration. He returned in 2005 and briefly teamed up with Shawn Michaels before feuding with him in a SummerSlam 2005 match, which was subject of controversy. 
            This was because Shawn Michaels oversold all of Hogan's moves during the match, being upset that he had to lose because he was "clearly the better performer". Despite this, the two shook hands at the end of the match. Hogan later feuded with Randy Orton in 2007, resulting in a SummerSlam match which Hogan won.
            Hogan would have a four-year stint in TNA which involved both backstage and on-screen roles. Between 2014 and 2015, Hogan made sporadic appearances for WWE, appearing at WrestleMania 30 as the host, inducting the late "Macho Man" Randy Savage to the WWE Hall Of Fame. He also appeared at WrestleMania 31 along with the nWo for the Triple H vs Sting match. He was one of the three judges on Tough Enough before the infamous scandal saw him fired by WWE.
            <br></br>
            Hulk Hogan's racist scandal was a result of a leaked audio tape about eight years prior. The negative publicity saw WWE release him, erase him from history and remove him from the Hall Of Fame. Hulk Hogan has since publicly apologized several times, and the wounds seem to have slowly healed.
            Around later 2016-early 2017, WWE began to slowly mention Hulk Hogan on programming again. As of 2018, he is not in the same bad graces with the company anymore. As of March 23rd, 2018, WWE confirmed to PWInsider in a statement that they are in talks with Hogan, though he's not under any contract:
            “We have had discussions with Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan) about how he can help others learn from his mistakes, however, he is not under any contract with WWE.”
            Hulk Hogan is a 12-time World Champion, winning six times in WWE and WCW respectively.
            After his retirement, Hulkster made various sporadic appearances throughout the years. His last appearance in WWE took place at the RAW is XXX episode where he appeared alongside WWE Hall Of Famer Jimmy Hart to kick off the show.

            The couple was married from 1983 to July 2009, when their divorce was finalized. Hogan then married Jennifer McDaniel in 2010, and separated from her a year later.
            
            As the children of a professional wrestler, Hogan’s kids grew up in the spotlight. In addition to attending many public events alongside their dad, the entire family appeared on the VH1 documentary series, Hogan Knows Best, which focused on Hogan and Linda raising their children. 
            
            Most recently, Hogan expanded his family as he tied the knot with his girlfriend Sky Daily in a small ceremony in Clearwater, Florida, according to TMZ.
            
            Like Hogan, Daily is a parent as well. Hogan told TMZ that Daily has three children of her own and said he immediately got along great with all of them.</p>`,

            Upon signing for the WWF, he made his unofficial debut in a dark match on a SmackDown taping. He lost the match to Mikey Richardson. However, he did go on to win the next dark match against Aaron Aguilera. He was then put under a developmental contract and placed at the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the company's developmental territory.
            Still fighting under the moniker of Prototype or Mr. P, he held the Heavyweight Championship at the OVW for three months while also holding the tag team championship for two months with Rico Constantino.
            Cena made his official debut in WWE after an open challenge by Kurt Angle on SmackDown. Cena declared he possessed “Ruthless Aggression,” as described by Vince McMahon. He narrowly lost the match through a basic roll-up pin. However, his efforts were lauded by senior wrestlers like Billy Kidman, Farooq, Rikishi, and The Undertaker.
            However, his real shot at fame came after feuding with Chris Jericho, whom he defeated in an upset at the Vengeance pay-per-view. He then partnered up with Kidman for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship but lost to Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit in the first round. The defeat forced Cena to turn heel and attack Kidman as he blamed him for the loss. He also feuded with Los Guerreros, winning his personal feud against Chavo but losing the tag team bout against them alongside Edge.
            He then ignited a feud with Brock Lesnar, and it was during this time, that he started using one of his signature moves FU, named to mock Lesnar's F-5. He faced several big names like The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, and Chris Benoit and started establishing a name for himself.
            At Wrestlemania XX, Cena recorded his first win against Big Show, where he shockingly attacked the giant with a chain to pick up the win and become the United States Champion. Cena then competed in the Royal Rumble Match in 2005, where Batista eliminated him to win the bout.
            <br></br>
            In 2009, He faced Orton and had some iconic matches. Orton defeated Cena on multiple occasions with the help of his teammates Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase.
            John Cena also went on to win the World Heavyweight Title at Survivor Series from Jericho but his reign didn't last for a very long time as he lost the belt to Edge.
            Cena then shifted his focus towards the WWE Championship. He was involved in a Title match against Triple H and Randy Orton at Night of Champions, where he lost. A defiant Cena won the championship back at Bragging Rights in 2009.
            Cena then defended the title against a debuting Sheamus, where he took a shocking loss. He then got his opportunity at Elimination Chamber and picked up the win. He quickly lost the title to Batista later on that night which set up a match between these two at Wrestlemania 26. Cena wrestled Batista at Wrestlemania and took the win. After successful title defenses against Batista, Cena lost the title at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view.
            In the following year, he had a feud with a faction named Nexus where he was attacked by the group formed by Wade Barrett. This led to a match with Barrett and Cena lost the bout. Finally, Cena vowed to get revenge on the faction. His attack on the group members led to a match with Wade Barrett at TLC where the latter lost in vicious chairs match and put an end to Nexus for good.
            Cena then had some memorable matches as he faced CM Punk in the Money in the Bank match which was considered to be one of his best matches. He then locked horns with The Rock in WrestleMania XXVIII where the Great One defeated him.<br></br>
            After WrestleMania, he came face to face with the returning Brock Lesnar.

Cena became a Historic record-tying 16-time WWE Champion. He also challenged The Undertaker at Wrestlemania 34 where he lost to the legend in a completely one-sided squash match.
            In 2021, Cena returned to confront a clueless Roman Reigns at Money in the Bank. He challenged Reigns to a match at Summerslam 2021. Cena and Reigns had a back-and-forth match only for the returning Hollywood star to take a clean defeat.In 2004, Cena lost out to Big Show in the Royal Rumble. Cena then took it up to defeat Big Show on the next opportunity he got, and he did so at WrestleMania XX. The victory got him his first United States Championship. He successfully defended his title for just short of four months, after his title was stripped off him in a farcical manner. John Cena accidentally knocked Kurt Angle over, thus “attacking an official”.
            However, he then won it back from Booker T at No Mercy, only to lose it again. This time he was defeated by debutant Carlito Caribbean Cool, and the duo started feuding. Allegedly, Cena was stabbed in the kidney by Carlito’s bodyguard. However, this kayfabe injury was used to allow Cena to shoot for his debut film The Marine.
            On his return, he won the title back from Carlito and even defeated his bodyguard in a street fight match.
            Despite winning the title back from Carlito, Cena was not going to keep it for long as he lost it to cabinet member Orlando Jordan, after WWE Champion JBL, interfered in the match hitting Cena with his title belt. Cena instead developed a feud with the champion and eventually defeated him twice, at WrestleMania and an “I Quit” match. The Age of John Cena had finally begun.
            John Cena eventually lost the title to Edge in the first pay-per-view of 2006, where Edge cashed his Money in the Bank contract, and took advantage of a worn-out bloodied Cena, who had just won the Elimination Chamber match.
            Edge held on to the title by using dubious means such as disqualification and using brass knuckles but was eventually defeated by Cena winning the title back. Cena was then involved in a Champion of the Champions match where three of the WWE brand's champions were to fight it out in a Triple Threat match. Cena lost after interference from non-wrestler Kevin Federline.
            In 2007, he successfully defended his title but suffered a legitimate torn pectoral muscle which required surgery. His rehabilitation period was estimated to be around seven months to a year. As a result, he was stripped of his title. In 2008, he suffered another injury in the neck which also required surgery. The following year Cena finally regained his title from JBL but lost it to the new superstar of RAW Sheamus.
            At the 2010 Royal Rumble, Cena went on to defeat some of the biggest stars of the WWE franchise including Sheamus, Triple H, and Randy Orton to win back the title. He was immediately challenged by Batista upon winning the title, and a tired Cena lost. But Cena won it back from Batista at WrestleMania. He was then forced to join Nexus and he won the Tag Team Championship with David Otunga.
            Cena then again won titles from Rey Mysterio and Alberto del Rio. In 2013, he became one of the few wrestlers who have won multiple Royal Rumble events. He also won the World Heavyweight Championship from Del Rio but lost it to Randy Orton who defeated him twice.
